Welcome to University Connect's documentation!
==============================================

University Connect is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) platform written in Django for the backend and SQLite3 for database management. Bootstrap templates and jQuery have been used for the frontend.

Instructions to install, run and deploy the code is available on my Github repo link `here <https://github.com/Palak2033/university_connect>`_

Below, you can find the source code documentation. If you want to have a generic look at all the functions and classes, go to :ref:`genindex`, if you want to go through them module-wise, then you can go to :ref:`modindex`. If you want to search for a specific function, you can use :ref:`search`.
